Matching Card Game

This game features three levels: easy, medium, and hard.

The gameplay works as follows: all the cards are displayed for 2 seconds then flips, and then players must find matching pairs by clicking on them.

The game tracks the number of rounds played and the matches made by the user.

There are two main scripts: the Game Manager, which handles all game-related functions, and the Card script, which manages card data and flip actions.

I created the UI design based on my preferences, and I downloaded and added icons to the scene.
